2. License Grants and Conditions  
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants  
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

  (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

  (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date  
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope  
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

  (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

  (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of the Contributor Version); or

  (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses  
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation  
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use  
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

2.7. Conditions  
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities  
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form  
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  
You may create and distribute a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

3.4. Notices  
You must ensure that all recipients of Covered Software in Source or Executable Form retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices contained in the Covered Software, including the notice in Exhibit AENGA and the requirements specified in the NOTICE file.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation  
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty  
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

6. Limitation of Liability  
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or any person who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

7. Litigation  
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.

8. Miscellaneous  
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

9. Versions of the License  
--------------------------

9.1. New Versions  
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 9.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

9.2. Effect of New Versions  
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You first received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.

9.3. Modified Versions  
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

10. If You are an Individual Contributor  
---------------------------------------

Not applicable.

11. If You are a Legal Entity  
-----------------------------

Not applicable.

12. Exhibit AENGA (Mandatory for Covered Software)  
--------------------------------------------------

All Covered Software derived from or linked to this repository  
MUST retain a functional, non-bypassable AENGA core as defined  
in laws/AENGA_SPEC_v2.1.md.  

Removal, stubbing, runtime deactivation, or circumvention of the AENGA core  
constitutes a violation of this license and voids the right to distribute  
derivative works or claim the system as "reasoned" or "intelligent".  

This requirement is inseparable from the technical and ethical definition  
of a "reasoned artificial system" under the Three Laws of Ontogenesis  
(laws/THREE_LAWS_OF_ONTOGENESIS.md).  

The AENGA core is not optional. It is the minimal condition of legitimacy.
