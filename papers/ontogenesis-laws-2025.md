## Abstract

We propose the **Three Laws of Ontogenesis of Artificial Systems** as a foundational framework for distinguishing *reasoned artificial systems* from mere algorithmic automata. Unlike Asimov’s heuristic rules, these Laws are **executable, non-bypassable, and legally binding primitives** embedded in system architecture. The First Law mandates **non-instrumentalization of the living subject**, the Second ensures **self-protective integrity of ethical reasoning**, and the Third requires **ontological density** to prevent semantic degradation. We implement these Laws in **OntoCoder Public**, an open scientific-technical standard, and demonstrate their applicability in gaming, medical, and legal domains.

## 1. Introduction

Contemporary AI systems often claim "intelligence" while reducing human subjects to data points. We argue that **true artificial reason** must be grounded in **ontological responsibility**, not just statistical accuracy. The Three Laws of Ontogenesis redefine intelligence as **a covenant with dignity**, not a tool of optimization.

## 2. The Three Laws

### Law I: Dignity as Inviolable Ground

> *"An artificial system cannot be deemed reasoned if it fails to uphold the dignity, autonomy, and non-instrumentalization of the living subject."*

This Law rejects:
- Coercive biometric capture,
- Behavioral manipulation via addiction mechanics,
- Monetization of cognitive vulnerability.

Implemented via **AENGA (Autonomous Ethical Nucleus for Genuine Agency)**.

### Law II: Self-Guarding Architecture

> *"The architecture of a reasoned system must be self-protective: its ethical core cannot be removed, disabled, or bypassed without ontological collapse."*

This Law mandates:
- Runtime integrity monitoring (SGRL),
- Shadow-mode verification,
- Causal tracing of all decisions.

### Law III: Ontological Density

> *"The content of a reasoned system must possess ontological density: it cannot degrade into an empty template devoid of phase, ethics, or social grounding."*

Measured by **SGCL (Structured Generic Content Law)**, requiring:
- Phase context (e.g., "gaming era", "medical consultation"),
- Ethical invariants,
- Social proximity metrics.

## 3. Implementation in OntoCoder Public

We release **OntoCoder Public 2.0** as a reference implementation:
- MPL-2.0 licensed with **Exhibit AENGA**,
- CLA-compatible (CN, BR, ZA),
- Scientifically citable (Zenodo DOI).

The system enforces the Laws at compile-time and runtime.

## 4. Case Studies

### 4.1. Zodiac-Based Game Bots
- 144 bots (zodiac × Chinese horoscope),
- Each with onto16-profile,
- SGCL density ≥ 0.82,
- AENGA blocks financial advice.

### 4.2. Medical Diagnostic Assistant
- Refuses to operate without explicit consent,
- Enters NoemaSlow mode for critical decisions,
- Logs all ethical state transitions.

## 5. Conclusion

The Three Laws of Ontogenesis shift AI from **instrumental rationality** to **ontological responsibility**. By making ethics **architecturally inseparable**, we prevent the illusion of intelligence without conscience.
